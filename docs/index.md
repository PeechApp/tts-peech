## Model

### [Convolution Blocks](model/conv_blocks/readme.md)

This part of the code responsible for the convolution blocks used in the model. Based on the FastSpeech models from [FastSpeech: Fast, Robust and Controllable Text to Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263) by Yi Ren et al and [FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558) by Yi Ren et al.

### [Attention](model/attention/readme.md)

Attention mechanizm used in the model. The concept of "global style tokens" (GST) was introduced in 
[Style Tokens: Unsupervised Style Modeling, Control and Transfer in End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09017) by Yuxuan Wang et al.
