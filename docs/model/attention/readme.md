### [Style Embed Attention](style_embed_attention.md)
This mechanism is being used to extract style features from audio data in the form of spectrograms.

This technique is often used in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) such as Tacotron-2, where the goal is to modulate the prosody, stress, and intonation of the synthesized speech based on the reference audio or some control parameters. The concept of "global style tokens" (GST) was introduced in 

[Style Tokens: Unsupervised Style Modeling, Control and Transfer in End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09017) by Yuxuan Wang et al.
