### [Phoneme Prosody Predictor](phoneme_prosody_predictor.md)

A class to define the Phoneme Prosody Predictor. 
This prosody predictor is non-parallel and is inspired by the **work of Du et al., 2021 ?**.

In linguistics, prosody (/ˈprɒsədi, ˈprɒzədi/)is the study of elements of speech that are not individual phonetic segments (vowels and consonants) but which are properties of syllables and larger units of speech, including linguistic functions such as intonation, stress, and rhythm. Such elements are known as suprasegmentals.
