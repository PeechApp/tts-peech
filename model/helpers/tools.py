    Initialize embeddings using Kaiming initialization (He initialization).

    This method is specifically designed for 2D matrices and helps to avoid
    the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in deep neural networks.
    This is achieved by keeping the variance of the outputs of a layer to be
    the same as the variance of its inputs.

        shape (Tuple[int, ...]): The shape of the embedding matrix to create, denoted as a tuple of integers.

        device (torch.device): The device to which the model should be moved. Defaults `get_device()`

        AssertionError: if the provided shape is not 2D.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: the created embedding matrix.
