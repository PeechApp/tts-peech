class ConvTransposed(LightningModule):
    r"""`ConvTransposed` applies a 1D convolution operation, with the main difference that it transposes the
    last two dimensions of the input tensor before and after applying the `BSConv1d` convolution operation.
    This can be useful in certain architectures where the tensor dimensions are processed in a different order.

    The `ConvTransposed` class performs a `BSConv` operation after transposing the input tensor dimensions. Specifically, it swaps the channels and width dimensions of a tensor, applies the convolution, and then swaps the dimensions back to their original order. The intuition behind swapping dimensions can depend on the specific use case in the larger architecture; typically, it's used when the operation or sequence of operations expected a different arrangement of dimensions.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int): Size of the kernel used in convolution
        padding (int): Zero-padding added around the input tensor along the width direction

    Attributes:
        conv (BSConv1d): `BSConv1d` module to apply convolution.
