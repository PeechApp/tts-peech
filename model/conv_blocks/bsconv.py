class BSConv1d(nn.Module):
    r"""
    `BSConv1d` implements the `BSConv` concept which is based on the paper [BSConv: 
    Binarized Separated Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13549.pdf). 
    
    `BSConv` is an amalgamation of depthwise separable convolution and pointwise convolution. 
    Depthwise separable convolution utilizes far fewer parameters by separating the spatial 
    (depthwise) and channel-wise (pointwise) operations. Meanwhile, pointwise convolution 
    helps in transforming the channel characteristics without considering the channel's context.

    Args:
        channels_in (int): Number of input channels
        channels_out (int): Number of output channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int): Size of the kernel used in depthwise convolution
        padding (int): Zeropadding added around the input tensor along the height and width directions

    Attributes:
        pointwise (PointwiseConv1d): Pointwise convolution module
        depthwise (DepthWiseConv1d): Depthwise separable convolution module
